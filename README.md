# Book your hotel!
This project is the **first in a series** to learn about the framework developed by Facebook.
You can dynamically filter a dataset of hotels at your disposition.

As any project bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), you can:

### `yarn start`

to run the app in development mode and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Things to consider
>There're a couple of things to refactor in this proyect
-Convert stateless components to pure functions
-Implement Container/HOC pattern
